    "BERT is a large state-of-the-art neural network that has been trained on a large corpora of text (millions of sentences). Its applications include but are not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "- Question answering systems\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook, we walk through how BERT generates fixed-length embeddings (features) from a sentence. You could think of these embeddings as an alternate feature extraction technique compared to bag of words. The BERT model has 2 main components as shown below \n",

    "## 1. Tokenizer (Converting sentences into series of numerical tokens):\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer in BERT is like a translator that converts sentences into a series of numerical tokens that the BERT model can understand. Specifically, it does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splits Text: It breaks down sentences into smaller pieces called tokens. These tokens can be as short as one character or as long as one word. For example, the word \"chatting\" might be split into \"chat\" and \"##ting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts Tokens to IDs: Each token has a unique ID in BERT's vocabulary. The tokenizer maps every token to its corresponding ID. This is like looking up the \"meaning\" of the word in BERT's dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds Special Tokens: BERT requires certain special tokens for its tasks, like [CLS] at the beginning of a sentence and [SEP] at the end or between two sentences. The tokenizer adds these in.\n",
